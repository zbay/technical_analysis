This project contains some Excel 2013/VBA workbooks that help the user make sense of stock charts.

So far I've made:
* A MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) tracker for US stocks. This helps identify changes in price momentum.
* A Stochastic Oscillator for US stocks. This helps identify stocks trading closely to their recent historical highs or recent historical lows. Is there selling pressure, or buying pressure in the market?

Both of my projects so far make us of Quandl's free API, and cannot retrieve data more granular than the end-of-day OHLC. To use my workbooks will require a Quandl account, API key, and (http://help.quandl.com/category/240-installation)[the Excel Add-In].
